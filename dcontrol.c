/*
	dcontrol - controls dvd (and potentially other disc) playback via command-line interface

	dcontrol is intented to be largely compatible with mplayer's
	"slave" mode but its output is the complete audio/video mpeg
	stream (unlike mplayer which seems only capable of outputting
	separate streams when in slave mode)
	
	invocation:
	dcontrol <device> <mpeg output file>
	
	Once running dcontrol prompts for input commands via stdin
	and returns command results via stout.
